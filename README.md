# aquaPi
A fish tank controller for Raspberry PI - in early design phase

To get started, clone the repository to e.g.  ~/aquaPI  on your Linux system, then source ". aquaPI/init". This will initialize python and all dependencies. It will also explain how to run the development instance of aquaPi.

Windows is not supported as a development environment - in lack of a Windows PC I won't make any effort to support it. The target system is limited to Raspberry OS anyways.
